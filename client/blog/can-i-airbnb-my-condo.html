In this guide, we‚Äôll cover everything you need to know about listing your condo on Airbnb, from legal considerations to practical hosting tips.

- **Local Regulations:** Some cities require permits, impose taxes, or limit the number of days you can rent out your property.  
- **Mortgage or Lease Terms:** If you have a mortgage or are renting, your lender or landlord may have restrictions.  

**Pro Tip:** Always review your condo‚Äôs bylaws and consult local laws before listing your property.
