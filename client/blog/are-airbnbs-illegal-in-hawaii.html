## **How to Book a Legal Airbnb in Hawaii**  

If you want to stay in an Airbnb without breaking the rules, follow these tips:  

### **1. Check for a Permit Number**  
- Legal listings should display a **valid permit number** (e.g., "TA-XXX-XXXXXX" for Oahu).  
- Avoid listings that say *"sneak in quietly"* or *"don’t tell neighbors"*—these are red flags.  

### **2. Stick to Resort Zones**  
- On Oahu, most legal STRs are in **Waikiki, Ko Olina, and Turtle Bay**.  
- On Maui, **Kaanapali, Wailea, and Kihei** have more permitted rentals.  

### **3. Book Through Licensed Property Managers**  
- Some condos and resorts allow STRs if managed by licensed agents.  

### **4. Look for "Bed & Breakfast" (B&B) Listings**  
- B&Bs with permits are often legal, while whole-home rentals face stricter rules.
