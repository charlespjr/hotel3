Gift cards are a fantastic way to give the gift of travel, and Airbnb gift cards are no exception. Whether you’re helping a loved one book their dream vacation or treating yourself to a future getaway, Airbnb gift cards offer flexibility and convenience.  

In this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know about Airbnb gift cards, including how they work, where to buy them, and how to redeem them.  

## **What Are Airbnb Gift Cards?**

### **Key Features of Airbnb Gift Cards**

## **How to Redeem an Airbnb Gift Card**  
Redeeming an Airbnb gift card is simple. Here’s how:  

### **Step-by-Step Redemption Process**  
1. **Log in** to your Airbnb account (or create one).  
2. **Go to "Gift Cards"** in your account settings.  
3. **Enter the gift card code** (found on the back of a physical card or in the email for e-gift cards).  
4. **Click "Apply"** – the balance will be added to your account.  

### **Using Your Gift Card Balance**  
- The funds will automatically apply at checkout when you book a stay or experience.  
- If your booking costs less than the gift card amount, the remaining balance stays in your account.  
- If your booking costs more, you can pay the difference with another payment method.  

## **Tips for Using Airbnb Gift Cards**  
To make the most of your Airbnb gift card, keep these tips in mind:  

### **1. Combine Multiple Gift Cards**  
- Airbnb allows you to apply multiple gift cards to a single booking.  

### **2. Check Currency Conversion**  
- If your gift card is in a different currency than your account, Airbnb will convert it at the current exchange rate.  

### **3. Use for Experiences**  
- Airbnb Experiences (like cooking classes or guided tours) can also be booked with gift cards.  

### **4. No Refunds to Gift Cards**  
- If you cancel a booking paid with a gift card, the refund will go back to your Airbnb balance (not the original payment method).  

### **5. Give as a Last-Minute Gift**  
- E-gift cards are delivered instantly, making them perfect for birthdays, holidays, or spontaneous gifts.  

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**  

### **Do Airbnb Gift Cards Expire?**
