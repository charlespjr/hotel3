Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects travelers with hosts who rent out their homes, apartments, or spare rooms. Unlike traditional hotels, Airbnb offers:  
- **Unique stays** (treehouses, villas, tiny homes)  
- **Local experiences** (guided tours, cooking classes)  
- **Cost-effective options** (often cheaper than hotels for groups)  

The platformâ€™s success lies in its **peer-to-peer model**, allowing homeowners to monetize their properties while giving travelers more personalized lodging options.  

## **How Airbnb Disrupted the Hotel Industry**

- Hotels struggle to compete on price, particularly in expensive cities.  

### **2. Providing Unique & Local Experiences**

- Airbnbâ€™s "**Experiences**" feature lets guests book activities hosted by locals.  

### **3. Flexible Booking & Cancellation Policies**

- This has cut into the traditional **business hotel market**.

- Hotels have had to improve their digital presence to keep up.  

## **The Hotel Industryâ€™s Response to Airbnb**  

Hotels didnâ€™t take the disruption lying down. They adapted by:  
âœ” **Introducing boutique and lifestyle hotels** (e.g., Marriottâ€™s Moxy, Hiltonâ€™s Tru)  
âœ” **Enhancing loyalty programs** (points, free nights, exclusive perks)  
âœ” **Offering more flexible cancellation policies**  
âœ” **Investing in technology** (mobile check-in, keyless entry)
