Airbnb has revolutionized the way people travel and rent out their properties. However, understanding Airbnb fees can be confusingâ€”whether you're a guest booking a stay or a host listing your property.  

In this guide, weâ€™ll break down how Airbnb fees work, what charges to expect, and how to minimize costs for both guests and hosts.  

## **1. What Are Airbnb Fees?**  

Airbnb charges various fees to both guests and hosts to cover service costs, taxes, and other expenses. These fees can vary depending on factors like location, booking duration, and property type.

  - Booking subtotal (higher bookings may have a lower percentage fee).  

### **B. Cleaning Fee**  
- Set by the host to cover professional cleaning between stays.
