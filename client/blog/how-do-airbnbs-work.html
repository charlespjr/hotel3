## **What Is Airbnb?**  

Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects travelers with hosts who rent out their homes, apartments, or spare rooms. Unlike traditional hotels, Airbnb offers a wide variety of lodging options, including:  

- **Entire homes/apartments** (private stays)  
- **Private rooms** (shared spaces with a host)  
- **Shared rooms** (budget-friendly, communal living)  
- **Unique stays** (treehouses, tiny homes, castles, etc.)  

Founded in 2008, Airbnb has grown into a global platform with millions of listings in over 220 countries.
