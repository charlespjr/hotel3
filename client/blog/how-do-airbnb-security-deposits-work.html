## **What Is an Airbnb Security Deposit?**  

A **security deposit** on Airbnb is a temporary hold or authorization placed on a guestâ€™s payment method to cover potential damages, excessive cleaning, or rule violations during their stay. Unlike traditional rentals, Airbnb doesnâ€™t automatically charge this amount upfrontâ€”itâ€™s only claimed if the host reports an issue.  

### **Key Facts About Airbnb Security Deposits**  
âœ” **Not an upfront charge** â€“ The deposit is a pre-authorization hold, not an immediate payment.  
âœ” **Set by the host** â€“ Hosts decide the deposit amount (typically between $100-$500).  
âœ” **Refundable** â€“ If no issues arise, the hold is released after checkout.  
âœ” **Different from Airbnb fees** â€“ Separate from cleaning fees or service charges.
