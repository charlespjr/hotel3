## **What Is Airbnb?**  
Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects travelers with hosts who rent out their homes, apartments, or unique properties. Founded in 2008, it has grown into a global platform with millions of listings in over 220 countries.  

### **Types of Airbnb Listings**  
- **Entire Place** – A private home or apartment.  
- **Private Room** – A room in a shared home (host may be present).  
- **Shared Room** – A budget-friendly option with shared spaces.  
- **Unique Stays** – Treehouses, tiny homes, castles, and more.

## **Why Choose Airbnb Over Hotels?**  
Airbnb offers several advantages over traditional hotels:  

✅ **More Space & Amenities** – Full kitchens, laundry, and living areas.  
✅ **Local Experience** – Stay in neighborhoods, not just tourist areas.  
✅ **Cost-Effective** – Often cheaper than hotels, especially for groups.  
✅ **Unique Stays** – Sleep in a houseboat, igloo, or historic home.
