## Introduction  

Airbnb has revolutionized the way people travel, offering unique accommodations and experiences worldwide. But how did this billion-dollar company begin? The story of Airbnbâ€™s founding is a mix of innovation, perseverance, and a little bit of luck.  

In this article, weâ€™ll explore:

## The Origins of Airbnb: A Struggle Turned Success  

### The Problem That Sparked the Idea  

In **2007**, roommates **Brian Chesky** and **Joe Gebbia** were struggling to pay rent in San Francisco. When a major design conference came to town, hotels were fully booked. Seeing an opportunity, they decided to **rent out air mattresses** in their apartment to attendees, offering a cheap place to stay and homemade breakfast.  

This simple idea became the foundation of **"AirBed & Breakfast"**â€”later shortened to **Airbnb**.  

### The Early Days: Rejections and Persistence  

- **2008**: Airbnb officially launched but struggled to gain traction.  
- The founders **sold cereal boxes** (Obama Oâ€™s and Capâ€™n McCainâ€™s) to fund the company.  
- They applied to **Y Combinator**, a startup accelerator, and were accepted, receiving mentorship and funding.
