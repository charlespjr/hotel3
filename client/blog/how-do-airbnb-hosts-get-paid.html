If you're considering becoming an Airbnb host or are already listing your property, understanding **how Airbnb hosts get paid** is crucial. From payout methods to timing and fees, this guide covers everything you need to know to maximize your earnings.  

## How Airbnb Payments Work  

Airbnb operates on a secure payment system that ensures hosts receive their earnings reliably. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how the process works:

2. **Airbnb Holds the Payment** ‚Äì Airbnb temporarily holds the payment until 24 hours after the guest checks in.  
3. **Host Receives Payout** ‚Äì After the guest‚Äôs stay begins, Airbnb releases the funds based on the host‚Äôs chosen payout method and schedule.  

### What Affects When and How Much You Get Paid?  

Several factors influence your Airbnb earnings:  

- **Cancellation Policies** ‚Äì If a guest cancels, your payout depends on your chosen cancellation policy.  
- **Airbnb Service Fees** ‚Äì Airbnb charges hosts a **3% to 15% service fee** per booking.  
- **Local Taxes & Regulations** ‚Äì Some cities require occupancy taxes, which may be automatically deducted.
