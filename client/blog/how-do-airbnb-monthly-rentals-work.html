                # How Do Airbnb Monthly Rentals Work? A Complete Guide  

Looking for a flexible, cost-effective alternative to traditional leases? Airbnb monthly rentals offer a convenient solution for travelers, digital nomads, and anyone needing temporary housing. But how exactly do they work?  

In this guide, we‚Äôll break down everything you need to know about Airbnb monthly stays, including pricing, booking tips, and what to expect.  

## **What Are Airbnb Monthly Rentals?**  

Airbnb monthly rentals are properties listed on Airbnb that allow guests to book stays of **28 nights or longer**. These rentals often come with **discounted rates** compared to shorter stays, making them an attractive option for:  

- **Digital nomads** working remotely  
- **Relocating professionals** in between homes  
- **Travelers** exploring a new city long-term  
- **Students** on extended study programs  

Unlike traditional leases, Airbnb monthly stays provide **flexibility** with no long-term commitment, furnished spaces, and utilities included.  

## **How Do Airbnb Monthly Stays Work?**  

### **1. Finding Monthly Rentals on Airbnb**  
To search for monthly stays:

*Pro Tip:* Some listings offer **additional discounts** for stays beyond one month‚Äîalways check the pricing details.  

### **2. Understanding Pricing & Discounts**
